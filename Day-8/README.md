## Area Calc

### Instructions

You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that **1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters** of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

number of cans = (wall height x wall width) รท coverage per can. 

e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5 

                         = 1.6

But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the **result should be rounded up** to **2** cans. 

IMPORTANT: Notice the name of the function and parameters must match those on line 13 for the code to work.

```
test_h = 3
```

```
test_w = 9
```

# Example Output

```
You'll need 6 cans of paint.
```

## Prime Numbers

### Instructions

**You need to write a function** that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.

e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.

But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.

# Example Input 1

```
73
```

# Example Output 1

```
It's a prime number.
```

# Example Input 2

```
75
```

# Example Output 2

```
It's not a prime number.

## Instructions

Make a rock, paper, scissors game.

Start the game by asking the player:
```
> "What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."
```
From there you will need to figure out:

> How you will store the user's input.

> How you will generate a random choice for the computer.

> How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).

> And also how you will give feedback to the player.

You can find the "official" rules of the game on [the World Rock Paper Scissors Association website](https://wrpsa.com/the-official-rules-of-rock-paper-scissors/).

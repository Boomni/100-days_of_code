# Grading Program
## Instructions

You have access to a database of `student_scores` in the format of a dictionary. The **keys** in `student_scores` are the **names** of the students and the **values** are their exam **scores**. 

Write a program that **converts their scores to grades**. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called `student_grades` that should contain student **names** for **keys** and their **grades** for **values**. **The final version** of the `student_grades` dictionary will be checked. 

This is the scoring criteria:

> Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"

> Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"

> Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"

> Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"

## Expected Output

```
'{'Harry': 'Exceeds Expectations', 'Ron': 'Acceptable', 'Hermione': 'Outstanding', 'Draco': 'Acceptable', 'Neville': 'Fail'}'
```

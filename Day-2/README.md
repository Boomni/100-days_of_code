## Data Types

### Instructions

Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

**Warning.** Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.

#### Example Input

```
39
```

#### Example Output

3 + 9 = 12

```
12
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

## BMI Calculator

### Instructions

Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

**Warning** you should convert the result to a whole number. 

#### Example Input

```
weight = 80
```

```
height = 1.75
```

#### Example Output

80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) =  26.122448979591837

```
26
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

## Your Life in Weeks

### Instructions

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old. 

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

> You have x days, y weeks, and z months left. 

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers

**Warning** your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops. 

#### Example Input

```
56
```

#### Example Output

```
You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:
